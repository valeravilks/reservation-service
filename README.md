# Service for booking services

This project is being developed to solve problems in the service sector. The problem for small business owners is that many keep records of customers in notebooks and make an appointment over the phone.

The service is designed to help solve this problem and allow customers to make an appointment via the Internet.

For me, this project is for training and coaching skills in developing services from scratch. If you want to use this service, then only in the TEST format. To solve this problem, you will find ready-made products.
